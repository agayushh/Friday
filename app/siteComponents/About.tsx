      Hello, World! I am Chánh Đại — a Design Engineer passionate about creating
      high-performance, user-centric software solutions with intuitive and
      engaging designs. With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in building
      high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript,
      and modern front-end technologies. Beyond work, I love exploring new
      technologies and turning ideas into reality through personal projects. One
      of my key projects, ZaDark, launched in 2022, enhances the Zalo experience
      on PC and Web, surpassing 80k+ downloads on SourceForge and reaching 20k+
      active users on the Chrome Web Store (as of Sep 2025). I'm also the
      creator of React Wheel Picker — iOS-like wheel picker for React with
      smooth inertia scrolling and infinite loop support. It has earned 4k+
      weekly downloads on npm and was selected for ▲Vercel OSS Program summer
      2025 cohort. Let's connect and collaborate!
