        Hello, World! I am Chánh Đại — a Design Engineer passionate about
        creating high-performance, user-centric software solutions with
        intuitive and engaging designs. With 5+ years of experience, I
        specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using
        Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. Beyond
        work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality
        through personal projects. One of my key projects, ZaDark, launched in
        2022, enhances the Zalo experience on PC and Web, surpassing 80k+
        downloads on SourceForge and reaching 20k+ active users on the Chrome
        Web Store (as of Sep 2025). I'm also the creator of React Wheel Picker —
        iOS-like wheel picker for React with smooth inertia scrolling and
        infinite loop support. It has earned 4k+ weekly downloads on npm and was
        selected for ▲Vercel OSS Program summer 2025 cohort. Let's connect and
        collaborate!
